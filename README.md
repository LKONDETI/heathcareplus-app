# HealthcarePlus App

Welcome to HealthcarePlus, a React Native app built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) to streamline healthcare management for users. This project uses file-based routing and modern Expo features for rapid development.

## Features

- User authentication (login, signup, profile)
- Book and manage appointments
- View and submit health records
- Custom theming and reusable components

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the app**
   ```bash

   ```
   - Open in a development build, Android emulator, iOS simulator, or [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go).
